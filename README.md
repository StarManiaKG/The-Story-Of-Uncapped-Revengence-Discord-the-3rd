# The-Story-Of-Uncapped-Revengence-Discord-the-3rd

I think the title is self explanitory enough


**FEATURES**
Comes with a Linux Build already built in the "releases" section. If you need to change anything else up, for example where the game's home folder is, you can change that in "doomdef.h"

If you want to compile without Discord RPC (for some reason you weirdo) just use HAVE_DISCORDRPC=0

If you want to compile with Discord RPC (since you're actually a normal person) use HAVE_DISCORDRPC=1

That's mainly about it, i might try to keep stuff up to date but i'm not too sure lol

for this build, you basicaally get everything you get with the main build, but you also have momentum saved and stuff like that idk

# Other Stuff i want to say i guess

if you like this thing where i add a new source port to the github every so often then let me know since i think i'd be down for that

anyways time for legally obligated stuff or something idk
